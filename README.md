# generated-portfolio

I noticed that many web developer portfolios seem follow the same template. So to poke fun at this, I made a portfolio generator. It's simple vanilla JS with random functions that just pick a random element from an array. I could certainly have made this code cleaner, and one day I may give this a nice overhaul. Images are from Undraw.
